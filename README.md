# Customer Segmentation Using KNN with RFM Analysis

## Background: Why is Customer Segmentation Important?
Customer segmentation describes the process of identifying groups or segments of a company’s customers who have similar characteristics or factors.

The goal of this segmentation is to optimize marketing for each segment. Customer segmentation is important and vital for
- Optimizing marketing strategies,
- Maximizing customer value to the business, and
- Improving customer satisfaction and experience.

Grouping customers and prospects into customer segments with similar characteristics will help businesses to identify their target customer base. That way, a business’s marketing strategies can be effective and appropriate (not offensive, efficient, and relevant). So knowing customer segmentation will not only save time and money but will enhance the benefits as well.

Now that you understand why it’s important to segment your customers, let’s get started. This project will use the online retail dataset in Kaggle.

## What is RFM Analysis?
RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) is a key customer trait. These metrics indicate the behavior of customers because the frequency and monetary affect a customer’s lifetime value and recency which affect retention.

Because of that, the RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the recency, frequency, and monetary total of their recent transactions to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing campaigns. All three of these measures have proven to be effective predictors of a customer’s willingness to engage in marketing messages and offers.
